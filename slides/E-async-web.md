# Concurrency vs. Parallelism

| **Concurrency**    | **Parallelism**         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Interleaves work   | Parallelizes work       |
| 1 or more cores    | 2 or more cores         |
| Waiting for events | Waiting for computation |

Today, we're focusing on concurrency: _asynchronous programming_

# What's async?

- Concurrent programming model
- Very suitable for running large number of tasks
- Look and feel* of synchronous code through `async`/`await` syntax

**Well, not perfectly. We'll go into that*

# What `async` looks like in Rust
To get an idea

```rust
/// An async function
async fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    /// Await loading and parsing config file
    let config = load_config(CONFIG_PATH).await?;
    /// Await scraping job
    let data = scrape(&config.urls).await?;
    data.report();
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    // Set up a `tokio` runtime with default configurations
    let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
    // Run a Future to completion
    runtime.block_on(run());
}
```

*Question: What stands out to you? What strikes you as odd?*

---
layout: default
---

# Async in Rust

- Revolve around `Future` trait (~like JS Promise)  
  &rarr; `async fn`s return `Future`s

- `Future`s are inert
- `async` is zero-cost
- No built-in runtime
- Single- or multithreaded
- Can be mixed with other concurrency models
- `async` is relatively new and lacks some features

---
layout: default
---

# State of the `async` art
What you can expect doing `async` Rust

- Blazingly fast applications
- More interaction with advanced language features
- Compatibility issues (re: colored functions)
- Faster evolving ecosystem
- `async fn` in Traits not stable

*Work in progress*

---
layout: default
---

# Support of `async`

- Fundamental types and traits are in `std`
- `async`/`await` are native to the language
- Utilities/extensions in `futures` crate
- Async runtimes are third party

Example runtimes: `async-std`, `tokio`, `smol`

# Expanding `async`
&nbsp;  

**" `Futures` are cool, but why didn't I see them in the web scraper example?"*

`async fn`s and `async` blocks are syntactic sugar generating `Future`
<v-click>
<div>

```rust
async fn foo() -> u8 { 5 }
```
</div>
</v-click>
<v-click>
<div>

is equivalent to:
```rust
fn foo() -> impl Future<Output=u8> {
    async {
        5
    }
}
```
</div>
</v-click>
<v-click>
<div>

which is equivalent to:
```rust
fn foo() -> impl Future<Output=u8> {
    /// Create a future that is immediately ready with a value.
    futures::future::ready(5)
}
```
</div>

# Expanding `async` and `await`

```rust
let fut_one = /* ... */;
let fut_two = /* ... */;
async move {
    fut_one.await;
    fut_two.await;
}
```
<v-click>
<div>
Generates an opaque type implementing `Future`:

```rust
struct AsyncFuture {
    fut_one: FutOne,
    fut_two: FutTwo,
    state: State,
}
enum State {
    AwaitingFutOne,
    AwaitingFutTwo,
    Done,
}
```

*This and the following is not the actually generated code, but it's a good mental model*
</div>
</v-click>


---
layout: default

# Expanding `async` and `await` (2)

```rust
impl Future for AsyncFuture {
    type Output = ();

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<()> {
        loop {
            match self.state {
                State::AwaitingFutOne => match self.fut_one.poll(/* - snip - */) {
                    Poll::Ready(()) => self.state = State::AwaitingFutTwo,
                    Poll::Pending => return Poll::Pending,
                }
                State::AwaitingFutTwo => match self.fut_two.poll(/* - snip - */) {
                    Poll::Ready(()) => self.state = State::Done,
                    Poll::Pending => return Poll::Pending,
                }
                State::Done => return Poll::Ready(()),
            }
        }
    }
}   
```

Kind of looks like `AndThenFut`!

# `async`/`await` expansion takeaways

- Rust generates state machines out of `await`s
- Generated code may become very complex, but original is easy to follow


---
layout: default
---

# * `async` and lifetime elision
&nbsp;
`async fn`s which accept references, return a `Future` bound by argument lifetime:

```rust
async fn foo(x: &u8) -> u8 { *x }
```

is equivalent to:
```rust
fn foo_expanded<'a>(x: &'a u8) -> impl Future<Output = u8> + 'a {
    async move { *x }
}
```

- `async move` takes ownership of any variables it references
  - i.e. `x`, which itself is a *reference*
- The returned `impl Future` internally holds the references
- The returned `impl Future` must be `await`ed within `'a`
