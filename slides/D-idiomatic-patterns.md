# Dynamic dispatch
*What if don't know the concrete type implementing the trait at compile time?*

```rust{all|1-8|10-12|14-23|17-20}
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

struct FileLogger { log_path: PathBuf }
impl Write for FileLogger { /* - snip -*/}

struct StdOutLogger;
impl Write for StdOutLogger { /* - snip -*/}

fn log<L: Write>(entry: &str, logger: &mut L) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    let mut logger = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => StdOutLogger,
    };
    
    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", &mut logger);

# Trait objects to the rescue

- Opaque type that implements a set of traits
- Type description: `dyn T: !Sized` where `T` is a `trait`
- Like slices, Trait Objects always live behind pointers (`&dyn T`, `&mut dyn T`, `Box<dyn T>`, `...`)
- Concrete underlying types are erased from trait object

```rust{all|5-7}
fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };
}
```

# Layout of trait objects

# Fixing dynamic logger

- Trait objects `&dyn T`, `Box<dyn T>`, ... implement `T`!

```rust{all|9-12|1-2}
// We no longer require L be `Sized`, so to accept trait objects
fn log<L: Write + ?Sized>(entry: &str, logger: &mut L) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };

    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", logger);
}
```
And all is well!

layout: default

# Forcing dynamic dispatch

Sometimes you want to enforce API users (or colleagues) to use dynamic dispatch

```rust{all|1}
fn log(entry: &str, logger: &mut dyn Write) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };


    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", &mut logger);
}
```

---
layout: default
---

# Fixing the renderer

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut shapes = Vec::new();
    let circle = Circle;
    shapes.push(circle);
    let rect = Rectangle;
    shapes.push(rect);
    shapes.iter().for_each(|shape| shape.paint());
}
```
<v-click>
Becomes

```rust{all|2,3,5}
fn main() {
    let mut shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Render>> = Vec::new();
    let circle = Box::new(Circle);
    shapes.push(circle);
    let rect = Box::new(Rectangle);
    shapes.push(rect);
    shapes.iter().for_each(|shape| shape.paint());
}
```

All set!

# Trait object limitations

- Pointer indirection cost
- Harder to debug
- Type erasure
- Not all traits work:

*Traits need to be 'Object Safe'*


---
layout: default
---

# Object safety

In order for a trait to be object safe, these conditions need to be met:

- If `trait T: Y`, then`Y` must be object safe
- trait `T` must not be `Sized`
- No associated constants allowed
- No associated types with generic allowed
- All associated functions must either be dispatchable from a trait object, or explicitly non-dispatchable

Details in [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety). Read them!

---
layout: default
---

# So far...

- Trait objects allow for dynamic dispatch and heterogeneous 
- Trait objects introduce pointer indirection
- Traits need to be object safe to make trait objects out of them

# Design patterns in Rust

---
layout: default
---

# Why learn design patterns?

- Common problems call for common, tried an tested solutions
- Make crate architecture more clear
- Speed up development
- Rust does some patterns ever-so-slightly differently

---
layout: default
---

# What we'll do

```rust
const PATTERNS: &[Pattern] = &[
    Pattern::new("Newtype"),
    Pattern::new("RAII with guards"),
    Pattern::new("Typestate"),
    Pattern::new("Visitor"),
];
fn main() {
    for pattern in PATTERNS {
        pattern.introduce();
        pattern.show_example();
        pattern.when_to_use();
    }
}
```

---
layout: statement
---

# 1. The Newtype pattern
a small but useful pattern

---
layout: default
---

# Newtype: introduction
&nbsp;

### Wrap an external type in a new local type

```rust
pub struct Imei(String)
```

That's it!

---
layout: default
---

# Newtype: example

```rust
pub enum ValidateImeiError { /* - snip - */}

pub struct Imei(String);

impl Imei {
    fn validate(imei: &str) -> Result<(), ValidateImeiError> {
        todo!();
    }
}

impl TryFrom<String> for Imei {
    type Error = ValidateImeiError;

    fn try_from(imei: String) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        Self::validate(&imei)?;
        Ok(Self(imei))
    }
}

fn register_phone(imei: Imei, label: String) {
    // We can certain `imei` is valid here
}
```

---
layout: default
---

# Newtype: when to use

Newtype solves some problems:
- Orphan rule: no `impl`s for external `trait`s on external types
- Allow for semantic typing (`url` example from mod B)
- Enforce input validation

---
layout: statement
---

# 2. The RAII guard pattern
More robust resource handling

---
layout: default
---

# RAII Guards: introduction

- Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (?)
- Couple resource aquisition and forfeiture with lifetime of a variable
- Guard constructor initializes resource, destructor frees it
- Access resource through the guard

*Do you know of an example?*

---
layout: two-cols
---

# RAII Guards: example

```rust
pub struct Transaction<'c> {
    connection: &'c mut Connection,
    did_commit: bool,
    id: usize,
}

impl<'c> Transaction<'c> {
    pub fn begin(connection: &'c mut Connection)
     -> Self {
        let id = 
            connection.start_transaction();
        Self {
            did_commit: false,
            id,
            connection,
        }
    }

    pub fn query(&self sql: &str) { /* - snip - */}

    pub fn commit(self) {
        self.did_commit = true;
    }
}
```
::right::
<div style="padding-left:10px; padding-top: 50px;">

```rust
impl Drop for Transaction<'_> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if self.did_commit {
            self
                .connection
                .commit_transaction(self.id);
            
        } else {
            self
                .connection
                .rollback_transaction(self.id);
        }
    }
}
```
</div>

---

# RAII Guards: when to use

- Ensure a resource is freed at some point
- Ensure invariants hold while guard lives

---
layout: statement
---

# 3. The Typestate pattern
Encode state in the type

---
layout: default
---

# Typestate: introduction

- Define uninitializable types for each state of your object
```rust
pub enum Ready {} // No variants, cannot be initialized
```
<v-click>

- Make your type generic over its state using `std::marker::PhantomData`
- Implement methods only for relevant states
- Methods that update state take owned `self` and return instance with new state

*ðŸ‘» `PhantomData<T>` makes types act like they own a `T`, and takes no space*
</v-click>
---
layout: two-cols
---

# Typestate: example

```rust
pub enum Idle {} // Nothing to do
pub enum ItemSelected {} // Item was selected
pub enum MoneyInserted {} // Money was inserted

pub struct CoffeeMachine<S> {
    _state: PhantomData<S>,
}

impl<CS> CoffeeMachine<CS> {
    /// Just update the state
    fn into_state<NS>(self) -> CoffeeMachine<NS> {
        CoffeeMachine {
            _state: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

impl CoffeeMachine<Idle> {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            _state: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}
```

::right::
<div style="padding-left:10px; padding-top: 0;">

```rust
impl CoffeeMachine<Idle> {
    fn select_item(self, item: usize) -> CoffeeMachine<ItemSelected> {
        println!("Selected item {item}");
        self.into_state()
    }
}

impl CoffeeMachine<ItemSelected> {
    fn insert_money(self) -> CoffeeMachine<MoneyInserted> {
        println!("Money inserted!");
        self.insert_money()
    }
}

impl CoffeeMachine<MoneyInserted> {
    fn make_beverage(self) -> CoffeeMachine<Idle> {
        println!("There you go!");
        self.into_state()
    }
}
```
</div>

# Typestate: when to use

- Ensure at compile time that no invalid operation is done
