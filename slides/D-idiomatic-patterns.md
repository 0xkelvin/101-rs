# Trait... Object?
- We learned about traits in module A3
- We learned about generics and `monomorphization`

There's more to this story though...

# Dynamic dispatch
*What if don't know the concrete type implementing the trait at compile time?*

```rust{all|1-8|10-12|14-23|17-20}
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

struct FileLogger { log_path: PathBuf }
impl Write for FileLogger { /* - snip -*/}

struct StdOutLogger;
impl Write for StdOutLogger { /* - snip -*/}

fn log<L: Write>(entry: &str, logger: &mut L) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    let mut logger = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => StdOutLogger,
    };
    
    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", &mut logger);

# Trait objects to the rescue

- Opaque type that implements a set of traits
- Type description: `dyn T: !Sized` where `T` is a `trait`
- Like slices, Trait Objects always live behind pointers (`&dyn T`, `&mut dyn T`, `Box<dyn T>`, `...`)
- Concrete underlying types are erased from trait object

```rust{all|5-7}
fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };
}
```

# Fixing dynamic logger

- Trait objects `&dyn T`, `Box<dyn T>`, ... implement `T`!

```rust{all|9-12|1-2}
// We no longer require L be `Sized`, so to accept trait objects
fn log<L: Write + ?Sized>(entry: &str, logger: &mut L) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };

    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", logger);
}
```
And all is well!

# Forcing dynamic dispatch

Sometimes you want to enforce API users (or colleagues) to use dynamic dispatch

```rust{all|1}
fn log(entry: &str, logger: &mut dyn Write) {
    write!(logger, "{}", entry);
}

fn main() {
    let log_file: Option<PathBuf> = 
        todo!("read args");
    // Create a trait object that implements `Write`
    let logger: &mut dyn Write = match log_file {
        Some(log_path) => &mut FileLogger { log_path },
        Nome => &mut StdOutLogger,
    };


    log("Hello, world!ðŸ¦€", &mut logger);
}
```

---
layout: default

# Fixing the renderer

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut shapes = Vec::new();
    let circle = Circle;
    shapes.push(circle);
    let rect = Rectangle;
    shapes.push(rect);
    shapes.iter().for_each(|shape| shape.paint());
}
```
<v-click>
Becomes

```rust{all|2,3,5}
fn main() {
    let mut shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Render>> = Vec::new();
    let circle = Box::new(Circle);
    shapes.push(circle);
    let rect = Box::new(Rectangle);
    shapes.push(rect);
    shapes.iter().for_each(|shape| shape.paint());
}
```

All set!

# Trait object limitations

- Pointer indirection cost
- Harder to debug
- Type erasure
- Not all traits work:

*Traits need to be 'Object Safe'*


---
layout: default
---

# Object safety

In order for a trait to be object safe, these conditions need to be met:

- If `trait T: Y`, then`Y` must be object safe
- trait `T` must not be `Sized`
- No associated constants allowed
- No associated types with generic allowed
- All associated functions must either be dispatchable from a trait object, or explicitly non-dispatchable

Details in [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety). Read them!

---
layout: default
---

# So far...

- Trait objects allow for dynamic dispatch and heterogeneous 
- Trait objects introduce pointer indirection
- Traits need to be object safe to make trait objects out of them
